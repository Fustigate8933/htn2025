# CORS Fix Verification

## Issue Fixed
The CORS error was occurring because the frontend was trying to fetch files directly from Google Cloud Storage URLs, which don't have CORS headers configured for the frontend domain.

## Solution Applied
Instead of fetching files from GCS URLs, the workflow now uses the original file objects from the upload process:

### Before (Causing CORS Error):
```typescript
// This caused CORS errors when fetching from GCS
const voiceBlob = await fetch(uploadedFiles.value.voice.url).then(r => r.blob())
const faceBlob = await fetch(uploadedFiles.value.face.url).then(r => r.blob())
```

### After (CORS Fixed):
```typescript
// This uses the original file objects, no CORS issues
formData.append('audio_file', uploadData.value.voiceFile, uploadData.value.voiceFile.name)
formData.append('video_file', uploadData.value.faceFile, uploadData.value.faceFile.name)
```

## Files Modified
- `app/composables/useWorkflow.ts` - Updated to use original file objects instead of fetching from URLs
- `app/pages/presentation.vue` - Enhanced video URL handling for better error checking

## Testing the Fix

1. **Upload Files**: Upload PPT, face video, and voice files
2. **Generate Content**: Click "Generate Content" button
3. **Check Console**: Should no longer see CORS errors
4. **Verify Flow**: The generation should proceed through all steps:
   - PPT processing ✅
   - Script generation ✅
   - Batch video generation ✅
   - Presentation mode ✅

## Expected Behavior
- No CORS errors in browser console
- Files are properly passed to batch generation API
- Avatar videos are generated successfully
- Presentation mode works with real video URLs

## Alternative Solutions (if needed)
If CORS issues persist, we could:
1. Configure CORS on the GCS bucket
2. Use a backend proxy to fetch files
3. Store files temporarily on the backend server
